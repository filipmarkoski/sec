             "previously disclosed scheme to hack into the SEC's EDGAR system "
             'and extract nonpublic information to use for illegal trading.  '
             'The SEC charged a Ukrainian hacker, six individual traders in '
             'California, Ukraine, and Russia, and two entities.  The hacker '
             'and some of the traders were also involved in a similar scheme '
             'to hack into newswire services and trade on information that had '
             'not yet been released to the public.  The SEC charged the hacker '
             'and other traders for that conduct in 2015 (see \n'

             'attention to EDGAR and, using deceptive hacking techniques, '
             'gained access in 2016.  Ieremenko extracted EDGAR files '
             'containing nonpublic earnings results.  The information was '
             'passed to individuals who used it to trade in the narrow window '
             'between when the files were extracted from SEC systems and when '
             'the companies released the information to the public.  In total, '
             'the traders traded before at least 157 earnings releases from '
             'May to October 2016 and generated at least $4.1 million in '
             'illegal profits.\n'

             'controls that require user authentication and then navigated '
             'within the EDGAR system.  Ieremenko obtained nonpublic "test '
             'files," which issuers can elect to submit in advance of making '
             'their official filings to help make sure EDGAR will process the '
             'filings as intended.  Issuers sometimes elected to include '
             'nonpublic information in test filings, such as actual quarterly '
             'earnings results not yet released to the public.  Ieremenko '

             'criminal information charging Glick, a Chicago-based investment '
             'adviser, with wire fraud.\n'
             'According to the plea agreement, from at least 2011 through at '
             'least 2017, Glick engaged in a fraudulent scheme to benefit '
             'himself to the financial detriment of his clients and two '
             'financial institutions.  According to the plea agreement, as '
             'part of the scheme, Glick misappropriated at least $5.2 million '
             'dollars from clients, provided financial institutions with '
             'forged checks and other documents, and lied to clients about the '
             'use, status, and safety of their invested funds.  The plea '
             'agreement further states that most of the funds that Glick '
             'misappropriated belonged to elderly clients, including his '
             'mother-in-law and father-in-law and an individual in a nursing '

             'numerous public shell companies.\xa0 Under the terms of their '

             'and appointing nominal officers and directors, who also acted as '

             'companies.\xa0 Despite numerous audit failures and red flags, '
             'Weinberg and his firm issued audit reports falsely asserting '

{'content': ['The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it '
             'obtained final judgments against a Ridgefield, Connecticut-based '
             'hedge fund manager and his investment advisory businesses.  The '
             'federal court in Connecticut ordered the defendants to pay '
             'nearly $13 million in disgorgement and penalties after the court '
             'had previously determined that the defendants had illegally '
             'diverted investor money for use by other hedge funds that were '
             'illiquid and in need of cash.\n'
             'The court earlier found Stephen Hicks and the businesses liable '
             "on the SEC's claim that they misappropriated investor funds.  "
             'The SEC alleged that investors were defrauded because they were '
             'not told about the transfers of hedge fund assets while they '
             "were taking place.  According to the SEC's complaint, Hicks sent "
             'a letter to investors admitting that legal and administrative '
             'expenses had been improperly allocated between funds, but rather '
             'than repaying the money, he transferred illiquid securities to '
             'the funds.\n'
             'The February 10th judgments against Stephen Hicks, Southridge '
             'Capital Management LLC, and Southridge Advisors LLC incorporated '
             'the Partial Final Judgment issued by the District Court on '
             'August 2, 2017.  The Final Judgment enjoined the Southridge '
             'entities and Hicks from violating Section 10(b) of the '
             'Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; '
             'Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Section 206(1), '
             '(2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule '
             '206(4)-8 thereunder, and required them to pay $7,864,064 in '
             'disgorgement and prejudgment interest that was previously '
             'ordered.  Hicks also must pay a $5 million penalty.\n'
             'The additional claims resolved by the final judgments involved '

             'Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments '
             'against Jamie Meadows and Eric McPhail, respectively, defendants '
             'in an SEC enforcement action filed in July 2014 alleging that '
             'McPhail, Meadows and others committed insider trading in the '
             'stock of Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corp.  The '
             'SEC has now obtained final judgments against all of the '
             'defendants in this case, and has obtained orders for full '
             'disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains against the traders.\n'
             "The SEC's complaint, filed on July 11, 2014, alleged that "
             'McPhail repeatedly provided non-public information about '
             'American Superconductor to six of his friends, including '
             "Meadows.  McPhail's source of inside information was an American "
             'Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club '
             'as McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, '
             'from July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail '
             "about American Superconductor's expected earnings, contracts, "
             'and other major pending corporate developments, trusting that '
             'McPhail would keep the information confidential, while McPhail '
             'instead misappropriated the inside information and tipped his '
             'friends, including Meadows, who improperly traded on the '
             "information.  The SEC's complaint alleged that the six traders "
             'profited by a total of over $554,000 through their illegal '
             'insider trading.\n'
             'The judgment against McPhail, to which he consented, enjoined '
             'him from committing future violations of the antifraud '
             'provisions of federal securities laws.  In June 2015, McPhail '
             'was convicted after a jury trial in a related criminal insider '
             'trading action brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of '
             'Massachusetts, and in September 2015 he was sentenced to 18 '
             'months in prison and two years of supervised release.  The '
             'judgement against Meadows enjoined him from violating the '
             'antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered him '
             'to pay full disgorgement of $191,521 plus prejudgment interest '
             'of $41,841, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $191,521.  '
             'Meadows had consented to a judgment with the injunction and '
             'disgorgement and interest amounts, and the court determined the '
             'amount of the penalty after a hearing.\n'

             'kickbacks to an investment fund representative in exchange for '

             'also prohibits Henderson from participating in penny stock '
             'offerings.\n'

             '2017 with operating an offering and investment advisory fraud.\n'
             'On December 22, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in U.S. District '
             'Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that Davis '
             'raised more than $5 million from approximately 30 investors by '
             'selling them fictitious financial products described as '
             '"corporate bond notes" and "guarantee bonds."  Davis hosted '
             'seminars marketed as the "Smart Money Academy" and "The Smart '
             'Money Millionaire Experience," and used his religious '
             "affiliation to gain investors' trust.  Investors believed the "
             'financial products sold by Davis were legitimate and would '
             'preserve and grow their investments.  The complaint alleges that '
             'the investments were not legitimate and that Davis fabricated '
             'documents and made false statements concerning the fictitious '
             'financial products.  Davis did not invest the money he raised '
             'from his clients, but instead used the money to fund a lavish '
             'lifestyle, repay prior investors, and further his fraudulent '

             'gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty from Davis, '
             'as well as disgorgement from relief defendant Affluent Advisory '

             'their customers would profit.  According to the complaint, since '
             'customers incur costs with every transaction, the price of the '
             'security must increase significantly during the brief period it '
             'is held in an account for even a minimal profit to be realized.\n'

             'that the transaction costs associated with their recommendations '

             'customer losses totaled $683,038 while Gennity and Roveccio '

             'In 2014, the SEC filed suit against DiCarmine, Sanders, and '

             'financial officer of Dewey & LeBoeuf, in conjunction with other '
             'employees, devised a scheme, and directed his staff, to '

             'meet lender covenants.  The SEC further alleged that DiCarmine, '
             "the firm's executive director, was aware of these efforts.  In "
             'March 2010, Dewey & LeBoeuf conducted a $150 million private '

             'that the drug was effective 60 percent of the time, far higher '
